# violet

violet is a simple etcd client written in Elixir, mainly only used for my personal projects. I pulled it out into a separate repo so I can use one thing for all my projects :thumbsup: 

## Installation

Add this to your mix.exs:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:violet, github: "queer/violet"}
  ]
end
```
